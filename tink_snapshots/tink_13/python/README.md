# Tink for Python

NOTE: This is still under active development and the API might change until the
official release.

## Documentation

For an overview of using the Tink Python implementation, see the [Python
HOW-TO](../docs/PYTHON-HOWTO.md).

In addition, there are illustrative [examples of using Tink
Python](https://github.com/google/tink/tree/master/examples/python/) which can
used as a jumping off point.
