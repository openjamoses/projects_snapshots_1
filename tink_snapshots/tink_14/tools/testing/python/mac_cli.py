"""A command-line utility for testing Mac-primitives.

It requires 4 arguments for MAC computation and 5 for MAC verification:
  keyset-file:  name of the file with the keyset to be used for encryption
  operation: the Mac-operation, i.e. "compute" or "verify"
  data-file:  name of the file with data for MAC computation/verification
  mac-file:  name of the file for MAC value (when computing MAC), or with MAC
             MAC value (when verifiying the MAC)
  result-file:  name of the file for MAC verification result (valid/invalid)
                (only for MAC verification operation)
