/**
 * An interface for streaming authenticated encryption with additional data.
 *
 * Streaming encryption is typically used for encrypting large plaintexts such as large files.
 * Tink may eventually contain multiple interfaces for streaming encryption depending on the
 * supported properties. This interface supports a streaming interface for symmetric encryption
 * with authentication. The underlying encryption modes are selected so that partial plaintext
 * can be obtained fast by decrypting and authenticating just part of the ciphertext.
 *
 * Security:
 * =========
 * Instances of StreamingAead must follow the OAE2 definition as proposed in the paper
 * "Online Authenticated-Encryption and its Nonce-Reuse Misuse-Resistance" by Hoang, Reyhanitabar,
 * Rogaway and VizÃ¡r https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/189.pdf
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * =============
 * Encryption must be done in one session. There is no possibility to modify an existing
 * ciphertext or append to it (other than reencrypt the whold file again). One reason
 * for this restriction is the use of AES-GCM as one cipher to implement this interface.
 * If single segments are modified then this is equivalent to reusing the same IV twice, but
 * reusing an IV twice leaks an AES-GCM key. Another reason is that implementations of this
 * interface have no protection against roll-back attacks: an attacker can always try to restore
 * a previous version of the file without detection.
 *
 * Blocking vs non-blocking I/O
 * ============================
 * Channels can be in blocking (i.e. always waits untile the requrested number of bytes have been
 * processed) or non-blocking mode.
 * If the channel provided to the streaming encryption is in blocking mode then encryption and
 * decryption have the same property. That is encryption always processes all the plaintext passed
 * in and waits until complete segments have been written to the ciphertext channel. Similarly,
 * decryption blocks until sufficiently many bytes have been read from the ciphertext channel until
 * all the requested plaintext has been decrypted and authenticated, an IOException occurred, or the
 * end of the plaintext has been reached.
 *
 * If the channel provided to the streaming encryption is in non-blocking mode, then encryption and
 * decryption are also non-blocking. Since encryption and decryption is done in segments it is
 * possible that for example a call attempting to read() returns no plaintext at all even if
 * partial ciphertext was read from the underlying channel.
 *
 * Sample encryption:
 * ==================
 *
 * StreamingAead s = ...
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel ct =
 *     FileChannel.open(path,
 *                      java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption.CREATE,
 *                      java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption.WRITE);
 * byte[] aad = ...
 * WritableByteChannel chan = s.newEncryptingChannel(ct, aad);
 * while ( ... ) {
 *   int r = chan.write(buffer);
 *   ...
 * }
 * chan.close();
 *
 * Sample full decryption:
 * =======================
 * StreamingAead s = ...
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel ct =
 *     FileChannel.open(path, java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption.READ);
 * byte[] aad = ...
 * SeekableByteChannel chan = s.newDecryptingChannel(ct, aad);
 * int chunkSize = ...
 * ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(chunkSize);
 * do {
 *   buffer.clear();
 *   int cnt = chan.read(buffer);
 *   if (cnt > 0) {
 *     // Process cnt bytes of plaintext
 *   } else if (read == -1) {
 *     // End of plaintext detected
 *     break;
 *   } else if (read == 0) {
 *     // No ciphertext is available at the moment.
 *   }
 * }

   * @param ciphertextSource the ciphertext
   * @param associatedData the data associated with the ciphertext.
   * @return a SeekableByteChannel that allows random read access to the plaintext.
   *    The following methods of SeekableByteChannel are implemented:
   *    <ul>
   *    <li> <code>long position()</code> Returns the channel's position in the plaintext.
   *    <li> <code>SeekableByteChannel  position(long newPosition)</code>
   *         Sets the channel's position. Setting the position to a value greater than
   *         the plaintext size is legal. A later attempt to read byte will immediately
   *         return an end-of-file indication.
   *    <li> <code>int read(ByteBuffer dst)</code>
   *         Bytes are read starting at the channel's position, and then the position is updated
   *         with the number of bytes actually read.
   *         All bytes returned have been authenticated. If the end of the stream has been
   *         reached -1 is returned. A result of -1 is authenticated (e.g. by checking the MAC of
   *         the last ciphertext chunk.) Throws java.io.IOException if a MAC verification failed.
   *         read attempt to fill dst, but may return less bytes than requested if reads to
   *         ciphertextSource do not return the requested number of bytes or if the plaintext
   *         ended.
   *         TODO(bleichen): Should we extend the interface with
   *           read(ByteBuffer dst, long position) to avoid race conditions?
   *    <li> <code>long size()</code> Returns the size of the plaintext.
   *         (TODO: Decide whether the result should be authenticated)
   *    <li> <code>SeekableByteChannel truncate(long size)</code>
   *         throws NonWritableChannelException because the channel is read-only.
   *    <li> <code>int write(ByteBuffer src)</code> throws NonWritableChannelException because
   *         the channel is read-only.
   *    <li> <code>close()</code> closes the channel
   *    <li> <code>isOpen()</code>
   *    </ul>
   * @throws GeneralSecurityException if the header of the ciphertext is corrupt or if the
   *    associatedData is not correct.
   * @throws IOException if an IOException occurred while reading from ciphertextDestination.
