"""A command-line utility for checking file integrity with a MAC.

It loads cleartext keys from disk - this is not recommended!

It requires 2 or 3 arguments:
  keyset-file: name of the file with the keyset to be used for the MAC
  data-file:  name of the file with the input data to be checked
  [optional] expected-code-file:  name of the file containing a hexadecimal MAC
  with which to compare the MAC of the input data
If expected-code-file is supplied, the program will print whether the MACs
matched or not. If not, it will just print the hexadecimal MAC of the data file.
